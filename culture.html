<div class ="container"><tb1><h1> Mandalorian Culture</h1></tb1></div>    
	
<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify"> Mandalorians (Mando'ade) are nothing without their culture and everything with it. Without their culture, their people would have died out along with the Taung. Recognising this, the Mando'ade reaffirm the ancient position that adherence to Mando'ade culture is what dictates whether one is Mando'ad (Mandalorian) or Dar'manda (Not Mandalorian).

<p align="justify">The most important aspect of Mando'ade culture is the Resol'nare, which translates to Basic as the "Six Actions" or "Six Tenets." The Resol'nare are:
    <p align="justify"><i>Ba'jur, beskar'gam,
    Ara'nov, aliit,</br>
    Mando'a bal Mand'alor-</br>
    An vencuyan mhi.</i> 

<p align="justify">Which translates to basic as:
    <p align="justify"><i>Education, armour,</br>
    Self-defence, clan,</br>
    Our language, our leader-</br>
    All help us survive.</i>  

<p align="justify">These simple tenets are what makes one a Mandalorian (Mando'ad) and nothing else.

<p align="justify"><i>Verd ori'shya beskar'gam, Mando'ad naas ures Resol'nare - A warrior is more than their armour, a Mandalorian is nothing without the six actions.</i></tb1></div>

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Ba'jur
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/bajur.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 177px; height: 137px" width="177" align="left" border="0" height="137">
<p align="justify">Education.  All Mando'ade are expected to raise their children as Mando'ade.  There is no typical education regiment, but most consist of firearm and blade practice, piloting, equipment upkeep and maintenance, Mando'a and the Resol'nare.  Some also choose to teach their children other skills, such as hunting, cooking, wilderness survival, battlefield medicine, machine repair, and other practical disciplines.</tb1></div>  

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Beskar'gam
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/beskargam.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 174px; height: 193px" align="right" border="0" height="193" width="174">
<p align="justify">Armour. Beskar'gam is the most outward display of being a Mando. Beskar'gam also says a great deal about its owner. While most outsiders (aruetiise) see identical sets of armour varying only in colour, each set of Beskar'gam is unique and tailored to suit its owner's comforts, fighting styles, and abilities.

<p align="justify">In addition to wearing the armour, Mandalorians are expected to be able to care for it and keep it in peak condition, ready for combat at a moment's notice.</tb1></div>

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Ara'nov
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/aranov.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 192px; height: 204px" align="left" border="0" height="204" width="192">
<p align="justify">Defence. Other than Beskar'gam, Ara'nov is probably the tenet that sentients most associate with the Mandalorians. All Mandalorians are expected to be able to hold their own in combat, regardless of sex, age, or profession. This fighting prowess is also expected to be put to use to defend one's clan (aliit) in times of need. Many assume that because of this tenet, all Mandalorians are soldiers by profession, but this is not the case; they merely recognise the importance of being able to defend themselves and those they love.  

<p align="justify">While anyone can obey the other tenets, Ara'nov is what separates the Mando'ade from the cowards (hut'uune).</tb1></div>

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Aliit
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/aliit.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 170px; height: 245px" align="right" border="0" height="245" width="170">
<p align="justify">Clan. Unknown to many outsiders (aruetiise) is the Mandalorians' emphasis on family.
Family is such a big part of Mando society that its organisation is centred around it in the form of clans. However, aliite in Mando society are far different than those found in most galactic cultures. Mandalorian aliite can best be understood with the old proverb, "Aliit ori'shya tal'din," which translates into Basic (English) as "Family is more than blood."  While it certainly is important to raise the children one gives birth to as Mandalorian, adoption is just as important and more widespread in some places. Adoptees are given the same status and treated the same as those related by blood. Through this practice, the Mandalorians have managed to keep strong throughout the centuries.</tb1></div>

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Mando'a
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/mandoa.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 125px; height: 210px" align="left" border="0" height="210" width="125">
<p align="justify">Language. Although some may disagree, Mando'a is extremely important. It sets Mandalorians apart from the outsiders (aruetiise), strengthening their bonds with those who have come before. It serves as a form of universal communication and a way to tie together what is otherwise an extremely diverse group of sentients. It also allows them to express themselves; through proverbs, poetry, and song. Not only that, but it allows them to say that which is indescribable in any other language. 

<p align="justify">Because of Mando'a, Mandalorians will understand each other when they say "shereshoy", even when no one else in the galaxy can. It is Mandalorian through and through.</tb1></div>

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Mand'alor
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/mandalor.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 153px; height: 184px" align="right" border="0" height="184" width="153">
<p align="justify">Sole ruler, Mandalore. It is no coincidence Mandalorians call themselves the "Mando'ade". This word translates to Basic (English) as the "Sons and Daughters of Mandalore." Mand'alor is never Mand'alore. They are the one ruler and leader of the clans. They are the most worthy warrior who takes the place of the previous Mand'alor after they joins the Manda (Mandalorian heaven – similar to Viking Valhalla). They lead the Mandalorians against those who would do them harm and those who they would have them harm. They are the embodiment of the ideals of te Sol'yc Mand'alor (the sole Mandalore) and the guardian of Mandalorian values and life.</tb1></div>
