<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Boba Fett
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/bfett.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Boba Fett was the first character to be shown wearing Mandalorian Armour in Star Wars. From a brief introduction in the controversial 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special, Boba Fett was first seen using the Amban Pulse Rifle that we would later see Din Djarin use almost 40 years later.

<p align="justify">Boba Fett made his first Live Action appearance in The Empire Strikes Back as the mysterious bounty hunter who captures Han Solo and takes him to Jabba the Hutt. He was later added to the Special Edition versions of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, although his tragic fate had always seemed written when he would be eaten in the following film, Return of the Jedi.

<p align="justify">Despite his short tenure as the galaxy's most notorious bounty hunter, novels would later have him survive and return to his profession, capturing bounties and making his mark on the galaxy. His character was also expanded further by the 2002 Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones, where it would be revealed that Boba Fett was a clone!

<p align="justify">Boba Fett's backstory changed due to the 2002 film, making him a replica of his father, Jango Fett, a renowned bounty hunter and template to the Grand Army of the Republic's clone army.

<p align="justify">Following Disney's purchase of Star Wars (through the acquisition of Lucasfilm) in 2012, Boba Fett was given a new lease of life in 2019's The Mandalorian, where he was first teased as having survived. 

<p align="justify">It would not be until the subsequent season of The Mandalorian, and the following Book of Boba Fett, that fans would learn of the mysterious hunter's true fate after his time spent in the belly of the Great Pit of Carkoon – a notorious Sarlacc Pit on Tatooine.

<p align="justify">Boba Fett would later team up with Din Djarin, helping each other out of tough spots – none more so than Fett helping Djarin by flying him in his specially modified Firespray-31-class patrol craft, Slave 1, when Moff Gideon blew up Djarin's beloved Razor Crest ship.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Jango Fett
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/jfett.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">Jango Fett was the father of Boba Fett. A well-known and highly sought after bounty hunter, Jango's success would later garner him the attention of Darth Tyranus – also known as Count Dooku – who offered him the chance to become the template for the Grand Army of the Republic, a part of a much larger scheme thought up by Dooku's master, Darth Sidious.

<p align="justify">Jango would be handsomely paid for his time and DNA, but he also requested a clone for himself – a son he would raise as his own and teach him in the ways of the Mandalorians.
 
<p align="justify">Despite the time he had with his son, teaching him how to become the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, Jango would eventually die at the outbreak of the Clone Wars on Geonosis when he was defeated in combat by Jedi Master Mace Windu – albeit with some help from an untamed Reek.

<p align="justify">Boba would later try and take revenge against Windu for his father’s death but to no avail. Windu would later be the first victim of the beginning of newly-knighted Darth Vader's Operation: Knightfall, otherwise known as Order 66.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Bo-Katan Kryze
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/bo.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Bo-Katan Kryze was the sister of Duchess Satine Kryze, the former ruler of the planet of Mandalore before and in the lead up to the Clone Wars. Despising her sister's ideals of pacifism, Bo-Katan would join up with Pre Vizsla and his Death Watch terrorist group, who would attempt to overthrow the Duchess and return the Mandalorians to the way of the warrior.

<p align="justify">Despite the schemes and attacks, Darth Maul would kill the Duchess (and later Vizsla), usurping control and causing the outbreak of the Mandalorian Civil War during the already harrowing Clone War.

<p align="justify">Fighting to retake Mandalore, the Darksaber – once owned by Pre Vizsla before his death by Maul – would be lost for years until the Rebel, Sabine Wren, would recover the ancient weapons of Mandalore on the planet of Dathomir. 

<p align="justify">Wren would later give the Darksaber to Bo-Katan in the opening stages of the uprising of Mandalore against Imperial rule so that Bo-Katan could lead the Mandalorians to victory.

<p align="justify">Bo-Katan's attempts to unite the clans of Mandalore with the Darksaber would ultimately fail, and she would lose the Darksaber to Moff Gideon during the Great Purge of Mandalore – it is believed that the Darksaber was lost during the Night of a Thousand Tears when Moff Gideon ordered the massacre of the Mandalorian people by way of planet-wide bombings.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Sabine Wren
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/sabine.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">Sabine Wren was a member of the Rebel Alliance's Phoenix Squad. She helped the Rebellion fight against the Galactic Empire and would play an essential role in returning the Darksaber to the Mandalorians.

<p align="justify">Although she did not win the Darksaber in a duel against its former owner – as is the custom – she fought to retain possession of the ancient weapon until she was able to give it to someone that she believed could use it to help unite the scattered Mandalorians clans against the Galactic Empire to retake the planet of Mandalore.

<p align="justify">Unfortunately, her efforts were in vain, and the Darksaber ended up in the hands of the Empire, where it would stay until the Mandalorian, Din Djarin, would defeat Moff Gideon in a duel whilst attempting to rescue the Force-sensitive child, Grogu.
</tb1></div>

<p>
<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify"> Din Djarin - The Mandalorian
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/mandodin.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify"> The Mandalorian, Din Djarin, is a bounty hunter that travelled the Outer Rim in his spaceship, the Razor Crest. He is the current holder of the Darksaber and technically the legitimate ruler of Mandalore.

<p align="justify"> A 'Foundling', Djarin was adopted by Death Watch soldiers into the enigmatic Children of the Watch cult that follows a far stricter version of the Mandalorian culture during the Clone Wars when a Super Battle Droid killed his parents. 

<p align="justify"> He would be trained in the ways of the Mandalorians and eventually become a bounty hunter, aiding the other members of the Tribe on Nevarro by sponsoring new members of the Tribe with credits and other items of value that would be used to help – including bars of Mandalorian Iron (Beskar) that would be used to fashion his new armour following his successful bounty completion and subsequent shenanigans that ensued when dealing with rival bounty bunters, Jawas, and the Imperial Remnant. 

<p align="justify"> He would later get tangled up in a fight to save the Force-sensitive child, Grogu, from the Imperials and wind up facing Moff Gideon, the architect of all the pain and suffering that the Mandalorians had faced as a result of the Great Purge. 

<p align="justify"> Upon his defeat of Moff Gideon, he would retrieve the hallowed Darksaber and begin to train with it while caring for the child, Grogu. 

<p align="justify"> Unfortunately, because he removed his helmet to let Grogu see his face when he handed him over to Luke Skywalker to be trained, he broke his oath, his creed, to the Children of the Watch and was therefore exiled from the only family he knew.

<p align="justify"> He left to find other work and was last thought to be heading to Mandalore to attempt to regain his standing with the Children of the Watch by bathing in the waters underneath the mines of Mandalore…

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">The Armourer
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/armourer.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">The enigmatic Armourer is a lore keeper and forger of Mandalorian Iron (Beskar). She is a member of the Children of the Watch – a zealous cult of Mandalorians that follow the Resol'nare (Six Actions) but with the added requirement that no one shall see the face of a Mandalorian once they have received their Mandalorian Helmet (Buy'ce). 

<p align="justify">She is a part of the Tribe, a group of Mandalorians that once lived on the planet of Nevarro in a secret Mandalorian hideout known as a covert. She would later set up another covert on the artificial structure called the Glavis Ringworld, where she would dismiss Din Djarin as no longer being Mandalorian as he had removed his helmet sometime before meeting up with her and Pre Viszla.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Paz Vizsla
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/paz.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Paz Vizsla is a Mandalorian and a member of the Mandalorian cult, the Children of the Watch. It is believed that he may be a distant relative of Pre Vizsla, although very little is known about him other than that he survived the attack on the Mandalorian covert on Nevarro following his rescue of Din Djarin and the child, Grogu.

<p align="justify">He and The Armourer are believed to be the only two remaining members of the Tribe.
