<div class ="container"><tb1><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/taung.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0"><p align="justify">Historically, Mandalorians – or Taung as they were first known – originally came from the planet of Coruscant. Then they were a species of grey warrior-focused aliens that grudgingly shared the world with what would come to be the modern human species.

<p align="justify">For hundreds of years, the ancestors of humans would battle the Taung in an attempt to seize control of the planet until an extinction-level threat sent volcanic ash across much of the planet. As a result of the disaster, the battle-ready Taung eventually fell to their enemy and were driven off-world. 

<p align="justify">For years the Taung travelled the galaxy, conquering worlds and taking their resources to best suit their needs, until they finally settled on a planet they named 'Mandalore' after their leader – Mandalore the First. 

<p align="justify">As a result of much of their travelling, they found their numbers waning and eventually took other species of aliens into their ranks, developing what would come to be known as the Mando'ade – the Children of Mandalore – that came to advance into what is now the culture shared by many across the galaxy.

<p align="justify">Although the Taung race died out long before Skywalkers and Fetts, the Mandalorian culture lived on and would become a respected (and feared) belief system that would be the basis of one being 'Mandalorian'; one such part of the culture would be the wearing of T-visored helmets that resembled the facial profile of the extinct race.<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/kadhodara.jpg" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0"><p align="justify">Although the main religion – the War of Life and Death (Akaanati'kar'oya) between Kad Ha'rangir, Hod Ha'ran, and Arasuum the Mandalorian Gods – died with the Taung, many different practices have risen in their place. These variations can be researched by following the link to the Culture section found on the Menu.<br/></div>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Coruscant
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/coruscant.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0"><p align="justify">The original homeworld of the Mandalorian race known as the Taung. Coruscant (Coruscanta) was where the Taung were driven from their home by the Battalions of Zhell, which led to years of travel across the stars. </tb1></div>  

<p>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Mandalore
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/mandalore.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Mandalore (Manda'yaim) The planet now known as Mandalore was conquered by the Taung once they finally chose to settle their people, many of whom had been lost in battles that had taken place during their long voyage across the stars. 

<p align="justify">Here, the Taung learned of Mandalorian Iron – or Beskar – which they were able to mine and forge into some of the strongest steel known to the entire galaxy.

<p align="justify">This Mandalorian Iron (Beskar) would be smithed into suits of Mandalorian Armour (Beskar’gam) that would provide them with immense levels of protection against most small arms fire and even lightsabers!

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Concord Dawn
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/concorddawn.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">Concord Dawn was the home system of the marvelled Mandalorian Protectors. Warriors who were chosen from the best of each Mandalorian clan were tasked to help safeguard the ruler of Mandalore.

<p align="justify">Many of the Protectors fought during the Clone Wars, aiding the Republic in later stages by providing cover fire make use of their fighters and their elite dogfighting skills, much to the ire of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
 
<p align="justify">Sadly, most of the Protectors were killed when they were betrayed by Gar Saxon, an Imperial Loyalist, who killed the Mandalorians in an attempt to secure power so that he could rule Mandalore of the Viceroy in charge of the Mandalore sector while doing the Empire's bidding.

<p align="justify">It is unknown if there were any other survivors than their leader, Fenn Rau.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Krownest
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/krownest.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Krownest is the home of Clan Wren, a clan that is loyal to the Mandalorian throne on Mandalore. Sabine Wren was once the keeper of the Darksaber before she handed it to Bo-Katan during the Mandalorian uprising on Mandalore against the Imperial Occupation, before the Galactic Empire's massive attack, which laid waste to the planet during the Night of a Thousand Tears.

<p align="justify">The status of Clan Wren or their stronghold on Krownest is currently unknown.

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Nevarro
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/nevarro.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">Nevarro is an Outer Rim planet, boasting many interesting landmarks, depending on your persuasion.

<p align="justify">Home of Greef Karga's Bounty Hunter's Guild office, Nevarro has several secrets hidden underneath its capital city and further afield. There is a hidden Mandalorian Covert – a type of base that the Mandalorian group called The Tribe calls home, including the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Din Djarin, Paz Viszla, and the mysterious Armourer.

<p align="justify">There is also a secret Imperial laboratory, which is believed to be the site where genetic tests are carried out to understand better how the Force works. However, much of that is believed to be rumours and fables made to scare the local children.
