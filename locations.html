<div class ="container"><tb1><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/taung.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0"><p align="justify">Historically, Mandalorians – or Taung as they were first known – originally came from the planet of Coruscant. Then they were a species of grey warrior-focused aliens that grudgingly shared the world with what would come to be the modern human species.

<p align="justify">For hundreds of years, the ancestors of humans would battle the Taung in an attempt to seize control of the planet until an extinction-level threat sent volcanic ash across much of the planet. As a result of the disaster, the battle-ready Taung eventually fell to their enemy and were driven off-world. 

<p align="justify">For years the Taung travelled the galaxy, conquering worlds and taking their resources to best suit their needs, until they finally settled on a planet they named 'Mandalore' after their leader – Mandalore the First. 

<p align="justify">As a result of much of their travelling, they found their numbers waning and eventually took other species of aliens into their ranks, developing what would come to be known as the Mando'ade – the Children of Mandalore – that came to advance into what is now the culture shared by many across the galaxy.

<p align="justify">Although the Taung race died out long before Skywalkers and Fetts, the Mandalorian culture lived on and would become a respected (and feared) belief system that would be the basis of one being 'Mandalorian'; one such part of the culture would be the wearing of T-visored helmets that resembled the facial profile of the extinct race.<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/kadhodara.jpg" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0"><p align="justify">Although the main religion – the War of Life and Death (Akaanati'kar'oya) between Kad Ha'rangir, Hod Ha'ran, and Arasuum the Mandalorian Gods – died with the Taung, many different practices have risen in their place. These variations can be researched by following the link to the Culture section found on the Menu.<br/></div>

Coruscant (Coruscanta) was where the Taung were driven from their home by the Battalions of Zhell, which led to years of travel across the stars. </tb1></div>

<p align="justify">Defence. Other than Beskar'gam, Ara'nov is probably the tenet that sentients most associate with the Mandalorians. All Mandalorians are expected to be able to hold their own in combat, regardless of sex, age, or profession. This fighting prowess is also expected to be put to use to defend one's clan (aliit) in times of need. Many assume that because of this tenet, all Mandalorians are soldiers by profession, but this is not the case; they merely recognise the importance of being able to defend themselves and those they love.  

<p align="justify">While anyone can obey the other tenets, Ara'nov is what separates the Mando'ade from the cowards (hut'uune).</tb1></div>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Aliit
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/krownest.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="right" border="0">
<p align="justify">Clan. Unknown to many outsiders (aruetiise) is the Mandalorians' emphasis on family.
Family is such a big part of Mando society that its organisation is centred around it in the form of clans. However, aliite in Mando society are far different than those found in most galactic cultures. Mandalorian aliite can best be understood with the old proverb, "Aliit ori'shya tal'din," which translates into Basic (English) as "Family is more than blood."  While it certainly is important to raise the children one gives birth to as Mandalorian, adoption is just as important and more widespread in some places. Adoptees are given the same status and treated the same as those related by blood. Through this practice, the Mandalorians have managed to keep strong throughout the centuries.</tb1></div>

<div class ="container"><tb1><p align="justify">Mando'a
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPShiels/set08101/main/nevarro.png" style="margin: 5px" width="200" align="left" border="0">
<p align="justify">Language. Although some may disagree, Mando'a is extremely important. It sets Mandalorians apart from the outsiders (aruetiise), strengthening their bonds with those who have come before. It serves as a form of universal communication and a way to tie together what is otherwise an extremely diverse group of sentients. It also allows them to express themselves; through proverbs, poetry, and song. Not only that, but it allows them to say that which is indescribable in any other language. 

<p align="justify">Because of Mando'a, Mandalorians will understand each other when they say "shereshoy", even when no one else in the galaxy can. It is Mandalorian through and through.</tb1></div>
